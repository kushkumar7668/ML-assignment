Ques 1. What are the assumptions of linear regression?

Answer-
    Linearity: The relationship between input variables and output is linear.
    Independence: Observations are independent.
    Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of residuals.
    Normality: Residuals follow a normal distribution.
    No multicollinearity: Predictors aren’t highly correlated with each other.


Ques 2. When should you use logistic regression instead of linear regression?
Answer- Use logistic regression when the target variable is categorical, especially binary (e.g. 0/1, yes/no). Linear regression isn’t suitable for predicting probabilities or class labels.

Ques 3. What is the interpretation of coefficients in logistic regression?
Answer- Each coefficient represents the change in log-odds of the outcome for a one-unit increase in the predictor, keeping others constant. Positive values increase odds, negative values decrease odds.

Ques 4. What is the difference between sigmoid and softmax functions?

Answer-
    Sigmoid maps values to a probability between 0 and 1, used in binary classification.
    Softmax generalizes sigmoid for multiclass classification, converting logits into probabilities that sum to 1 across classes.

Ques 5. Why is R-squared not suitable for evaluating logistic regression models?
Answer- R² measures variance in continuous outcomes. Logistic regression predicts class probabilities, not continuous values, so metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and AUC are more appropriate.
